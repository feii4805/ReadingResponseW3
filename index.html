        <h2>Quote 1</h2>
        <p>"Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and then, 
            when they share their work, for others. Of course, world-building means creating 
            everything—not only making things inside the world but also the surrounding world
             itself—the language, style, rules, and architecture."</p>
        
        <h2>Quote 2</h2>
        <p>"My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object 
            at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect 
            simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be.
             What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? 
             A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback
              loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity."</p>
        
        <h2>Response</h2>
        <p>The idea of a website as both a room and architect designs is really interesting. 
            It means a website isn't just a place to drop information, but it's also a space or 
            platform that someone has thoughtfully made. For artists, who are good at creating 
            new things, a website is a perfect place to show off their work. They can build the 
            space just how they like to tell a story or share a feeling. The website is like a mirror
             to the diversity of artists, reflecting their creativity. The website provides the ability 
             to let artists create and change both online and off.</p>
